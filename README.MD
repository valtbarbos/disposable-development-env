## Disposable Development ENV

This is a simple setup to use Ansible with Docker in Dev Container.

## Two Options

We can use `./run.sh` to exec the main.yml through a docker image which will act as a proxy to connect on our machine.

While developing we can use the shortcut `ctrl + b` to exec our `main.yml` using the VSCode Devcontainer environment.
